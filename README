- Secure file upload and download functionality
- Encryption of file data using the Fernet algorithm (AES-128 in CBC mode)
- Reliable file transfer using TCP sockets
- User-friendly web interface for easy interaction
- Handling of network interruptions and failures with automatic retry mechanisms
- Storage of encrypted file data in a SQLite database

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (Web framework)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Front-end)
- SQLite (Database)
- Cryptography library (Encryption)
- Socket programming (Network communication)
